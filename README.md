# Lab #01 - Hello CS112!
Welcome back, Java developers! We got some challenging material ahead, so it's probably a good idea to brush off the dust and rust and reestablish our fundamentals before we venture into new challenges!

For each part, you'll work in your group and we'll debrief as a class on vocab words for the part, key topics and concepts, pitfalls, tips and tricks, and anything else that comes to mind to help each other review as much as possible.

If there is anything you're stuck on or have questions on, now is a great time to ask! Start with your partners, if they don't have a satisfying answer bring it to the group discussion when we debrief. If you're still shaky, don't beat yourself up! Unit 0 is designed to give you time to refresh and address any gaps you have, so make a list of the topics/concepts/vocab you're struggling with and we can strategize together!


## Part 1: Starting a Java Program
Let's start slow and write a very simple program that just outputs a `String` of text.

In the Files list to the left, please click on `Main.java`, and create the `main()` method so that the program prints out the text: `Welcome to CS 112!`

## Part 2: Creating static methods
Warm-up is over, now let's get more technical. Create two static methods, one that is void and one that is value-returning and has at least one parameter. You can create it to do whatever you like. It can be very mundane, very useful, or anything in between

## Part 3: Creating programmer-defined class
The fundamentals of Java down now, let's get into deeper parts of Java. Specifically, OOP or Object-Oriented Programming. This was the last part you covered in CS111. It'll probably be the toughest part but we'll have plenty of practice this semester. The first two units (Unit 0 and Unit 1) are designed to help you review and ease into the new topics of CS112.

Create a class with one instance variable. Make sure the class represents ONE thing, and the instance variable is something that describes it. In addition, create the following methods (this order is recommended to make it easier for you):
- `toString` method
- mutator/setter for your instance variable
- accessor/getter for your instance variable
- default constructor
- full constructor
- `equals` method

## Hacker Challenge
If we have enough time, let's create a copy constructor! Not sure what it is? Search around and see if you can find a useful definition you understand, take a shot at creating it for your class.
